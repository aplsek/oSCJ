These are some directives how to put scj sources into OpenVM and build it with scj support. 
This is neither a complete nor a clever guide. The intention of this guide is to give a
direction to the people who want to play with ovm-scj. After everything is completed I hope 
this will be obsolete.

1. Create a directory named ovm_scj in OpenVM/src/syslib/user directory

2. Copy scj source codes in OpenVM/src/syslib/user/ovm_scj directory

3. Copy Makefile.in and Makefile.mk files from OpenVM/src/syslib/user/ovm_realtime directory to OpenVM/src/syslib/user/ovm_scj directory

4. In the OpenVM/src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/Makefile.mk file
    - Find ovm_rt_user_realtime.jar keywords and replace them with ovm_rt_user_scj.jar keyword
    - Find ovm_rt_user_realtime.zip keywords and replace them with ovm_rt_user_scj.zip keyword

5. In the OpenVM/configure file
    - Go to the line 11924 (which start with ac_config_files keyword) 
    - Add src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/Makefile statement at the end of this line inside quotes
    - Add "src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/Makefile") CONFIG_FILES="$CONFIG_FILES src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/Makefile" ;; (quotes and commas included) line after line 12502

6. In the OpenVM/Makefile.mk file
    - Add src/syslib/user/ovm_scj \ line after the line 20
    - Delete src/apps \ line which is at line 25 or 26
    - delete also src/syslib/user/ovm_realtime ?????????????????????????  
    - and delet also "src/apps/Makefile", line 80
    - Add src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/Makefile \ line after the line 92

7. Create a new directory named ovms (for example) inside the directory which OpenVM resides

8. Change directory to the ovms directory

9. ../OpenVM/configure 

10.  make

11. Go to the directory which you put compiled scjHello classes

12. Define boot classpath variable. Make the required changes according to your paths. 
rt=/home/harun/ovm-scj/ovms/src/syslib/user/ovm_scj/ovm_rt_user_scj.jar:/home/harun/ovm-scj/ovms/src/syslib/user/ovm_rt_user.jar:/home/harun/ovm-scj/ovms/src/syslib/user/ovm_platform/ovm_platform.jar

13. Run the following config. For ovms look at number 7.
ovms/bin/gen-ovm -threads=RealtimeJVM -model=TriPizloPtrStack-FakeScopesWithAreaOf-Bg_Mf_F_H_S -ioconfigurator=SelectSockets_PollingOther -main=Launcher -classpath=./ -bootclasspath=$rt

14. If everyting goes fine then run the command
./ovm img Launcher
