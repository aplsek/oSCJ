Provides services related to bytecode parsing, analysis (including verification), 
editing and writing.
<p>
The central class is the <tt>Instruction</tt>, which provides an implementation to query for
information about the instructions. 
<br>
The <tt>reader</tt> subpackage provides an interface to parse class files. The information
obtained from the classfile is put in bundels into the repository.
<br>
The <tt>editor</tt> subpackage provides interfaces to manipulate bytecode. The <tt>Editor</tt>
is the central object that can be used to manipulate the bytecode of a method. The <tt>Cursor</tt>
object can be used to insert instructions.
<br>
The <tt>verifier</tt> subpackage contains interfaces for bytecode verification,
which is an extention to abstract interpretation.
<br>
The <tt>writer</tt> subpackage can be used to write class files back to the disk.
<p>
Responsible for this package and all subpackages are 
<A href="mailto:grothoff@cs.purdue.edu">Christian Grothoff</A> and
<A href="mailto:jv@cs.purdue.edu">Jan Vitek</A>.
