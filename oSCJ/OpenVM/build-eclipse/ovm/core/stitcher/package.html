Provides runtime configuration information.

<p>A runtime configuration is defined by a {@link
ovm.core.stitcher.ServiceConfiguratorBase ServiceConfiguratorBase} subclass. 
The <tt>ServiceConfigurator</tt> holds the set of {@link ovm.core.stitcher.ServiceFactory ServiceFactory} instances defined in the current
configuration. A <tt>ServiceFactory</tt> allows access to a particular
set of {@link ovm.services.ServiceInstance ServiceInstance} objects,
each of which defines a particular runtime service of the OVM: threading, event
management, I/O etc.

<p>The name &quot;stitcher&quot; comes from the early implementation
days. Really the contents of this package could be relocated to
<tt>ovm.services</tt> or a subpackage thereof.
