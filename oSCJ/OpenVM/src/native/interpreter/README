This file describes the build-process of the 
OVM C Interpreter. If you have any questions, 
please ask grothoff@cs.purdue.edu.

In order to compile the interpreter, run

# ./build

If you just need to recompile, 

# make

is sufficient after that. You must run ./build
again if you change any Makefile.am or
the configure.in script.

In order to compile and run the testcases, run

make check

In order to run the interpreter on an image type

# ./interpreter IMAGEFILENAME


If you add a new file to the production code, 
you must edit Makefile.am (in this directory).
Add the file to the interpreter_SOURCES list.
If the testcases need it to, add it also
to libovm_a_SOURCES. You should also add
include files to this list. You do not have to
specify the full path.


If you add a new file to the TESTCASES, edit
test/Makefile.am. check_PROGRAMS has a list
of (free-choice) binary names for the 
testprogramms. Each testprogramm is independently
executed. The C files that each testprogram
consists of (including the main method), are
listed under TESTPROGRAMNAME_SOURCES.


IMPORTANT:
1) Never edit files that are not under CVS
   control. 
2) Never put generated files under CVS
   control. This includes Makefile.in,
   Makefile and several other autoconf/automake
   generated files.
3) If you need to do anything else but what is
   described above, better ask grothoff@cs first
   how to proceed!
