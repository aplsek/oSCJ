Contains the implementation classes for a user-level Java threading
system and associated monitors. This particular implementation group
is called <code>ulv1</code> for user-level threading version 1.

<p>The different design and implementation choices that have been made in the current system are discussed here. We also discuss some of the alternative designs, things that could, or should, be done differently, and things which are still to be done.

<h2>Thread Manager</h2>
<p>
The {@link ovm.services.java.JavaUserLevelThreadManager} implementation simply maintains two queues: one for threads ready to run and a delta queue for sleeping threads. The current thread is left at the head of the ready list.
