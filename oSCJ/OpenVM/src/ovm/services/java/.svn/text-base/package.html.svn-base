Provides the interfaces required to support an implementation of the
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using OVM. THe JVM support classes are
written to a set of <tt>LibraryImports</tt> API's which then map
through to a set of <tt>RuntimeExports</tt> API's. These latter API's
are defined in terms of the interfaces in this package. A particular
configuration of the OVM will provide service instances that provide
implementations of these interfaces.
