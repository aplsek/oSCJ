Provides the interfaces defining the functionality of monitors and
condition queues (sometimes known as condition variables).
<p>The interfaces do not define the particular semantics of any known
monitor type (Hoare, Brinch-Hansen, Modula-3, Java etc) rather they
define generic functionality for monitors and condition
queues. 
<p>The interfaces are not intended for direct implementation by
a concrete class, but rather serve as mix-ins to be combined into an
interface that defines a monitor or condition queue with particular
semantics. For example, {@link ovm.services.java.JavaMonitor} combines
all the attributes of timed and interruptable condition queue methods,
together with the semantics specific to Java (such as requiring
monitor ownership before doing a condition signal).
<p>To avoid confusion with any particular semantics we have chosen a
general nomenclature.
