Each subclass of Allocator represents an allocation algorithm. The allocation
algorithm is tightly coupled with the garbage collection algorithm.

Each memory area is bound to a single allocation algorithm and no two
instances of allocator objects will work in the same memory area. An
<code>Allocator</code> can use multiple <code>MemoryArea</code>s
(e.g. separate memory areas for different generations).

The RawMemoryAccess provides a mechanism to read and write primitives directly
into lower level memory.  The allocator uses RawMemoryAccess to perform work.
