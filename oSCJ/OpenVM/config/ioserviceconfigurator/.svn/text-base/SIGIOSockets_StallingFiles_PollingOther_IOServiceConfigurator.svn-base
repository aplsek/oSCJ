## -io=SIGIOSockets_StallingFiles_PollingOther avoids blocking the VM for
##        read/write type IO calls on sockets, pipes, and TTYs, but not on
##        files.  file IO throughput should be better with this configuration
##        than with others.  uses SIGIO for IO multiplexing for sockets.
