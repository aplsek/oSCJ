## -analysis=CHA Uses an implemenation of Class Hierarchy Analysis (one of

##   -forcepath=P takes a java search path (of the same form as
## 	-classpath) and treats every class  file on that path as if it 
## 	appeared in -ud-reflective-classes.  If forcepath contains
## 	every jar and directory of classpath and bootclasspath, a call
## 	to Class.forName cannot unexpectedly fail. 
#-forcepath is null by default
