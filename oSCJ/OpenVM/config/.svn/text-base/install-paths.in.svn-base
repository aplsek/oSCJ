## -image-argument
##    If ovm executables must be passed in the path to a binary
##    heap image file, this flag's default value will be "img", which 
##    works when ovm is run from the same directory where it is built.  If 
##    the contents of this file are embedded in the ovm executable, the 
##    default value of -image-argument will be the empty string.
##
##    This option is intened for use with ovm-config, and is not used
##    by gen-ovm itself.  See the regression test makefile for sample 
##    usage.
