# Any garbage collector whose name looks like *-B_Mf... will be compiled 
# with fast-lock support.  Examples include minimalMM-B_Mf, and 
# MostlyCopyingWB-B_Mf_F_H.  Currently, an uncontented, non-recursive
# lock can be taken in 11 x86 instructions, but this number could
# easily be reduced to 8.
