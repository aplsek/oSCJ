 * its Java run-time execution stack, there is also a native method stack (if
 * this memory is dis- tinct from the run-time stack). In addition, each
 * schedulable object has: a backing store that is used for any scoped memory
 * areas it may create and a number of bytes dedicated to the message associated
 * with this Schedulable object’s ThrowBoundary- Error exception plus all the
 * method names/identifiers in the stack backtrace.
 * 
 * This class allows the programmer to set the sizes of these memory stores only
 * at construction time (the objects are immutable). It is assumed that these
 * sizes are obtained from vendor-specific tools.
